<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, we needed to choose a tool that we had not used in class, explain what it does, give a demonstration of using the tool, and finally discuss ways of mitigating its use against yourself or an organization.
<br></br>
I chose Kismet and decided to wardrive my apartment building to enumerate the number of devices and what encryption types were being used.
